Chuo-Vote is a decentralized voting platform built to improve transparency, security, and trust in student elections and academic decision-making within Tanzanian higher education institutions. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures tamper-proof, verifiable, and auditable election results.

Why Blockchain?

Transparency: Votes are recorded immutably on-chain

Accessibility: Secure voting across multiple campuses

Auditability: Results can be independently verified

Cost efficiency: Reduces paper ballots and logistics
